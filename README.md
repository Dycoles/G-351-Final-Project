# G-351-Final-Project
Final Project for our Game 351 class
Game: Corgi Quest
Background: Your owner has left you at home, and he forgot his wand! Travel through an exciting new land and battle fiece enemies on your journey to return your owners wand!

Topics Implemented
1. Terrains and meshes- Painted terrain and lowered terrain to create a gap. The gap has a river flowing through. Added fog and changed the skybox to night to create a dark and ominous environment.
2. Implemented LOTS of scripting. Enemy AI to chase you, turn-based mechanics, Corgi movement, and the background music all implement scripting.
3. Animation and Motion: All characters have animations. We didn't have enough time to give animations for all possible animations, but we got a lot of the basic ones. Each character has movement, attack, and idle animations
4. Physics and Particles: We did not manage to fit the particle system in due to time constraints and issues with the turn based combat. However, we used the physics system and triggers to enter and exit turn based combat. In addition, the corgi uses a physics based movement system instead of just gliding along the ground.
5. Audio and Game Mechanics: We implemented footsteps, background music, battle music, attack sounds, healing sounds, and a roaring sound for the dragon.
6. User Interface: We added a health bar for the corgi and its enemies. During encounters, a UI will pop up, showing you what controls allow you to perform certain actions. 

Controls: WASD to move. Once in combat, 1 to scratch, 2 to bite, 3 to heal, and 4 to run away.
