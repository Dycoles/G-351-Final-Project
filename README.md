# G-351-Final-Project
Final Project for our Game 351 class
Game: Corgi Quest
Background: The backstory for the game is that you are the corgi companion of one of the most powerful wizards in the land. The said wizard gets called to complete a quest of their own and heads out of the house, however, they leave their wand behind. Pablo the corgi takes notice and grabs the wand to start a fetch quest to bring the wand back to his master wizard. The setting will be a fantasy forest type, and the beginning will start at the wizard and Pabloâ€™s residence which will be a humble cottage.

Topics Implemented
1. Terrains and meshes- Painted terrain and lowered terrain to create a gap. The gap has a river flowing through. Added fog and changed the skybox to night to create a dark and ominous environment.
2. Implemented LOTS of scripting. Enemy AI to chase you, turn-based mechanics, Corgi movement, and background music all implement scripting.
3. Animation and Motion: All characters have animations. We didn't have enough time to give animations for all possible animations, but we got a lot of the basic ones. Each character has movement, attack, and idle animations
4. Physics and Particles: We did not manage to fit the particle system in due to time constraints and issues with the turn-based combat. However, we used the physics system and triggers to enter and exit turn-based combat. In addition, the corgi uses a physics-based movement system instead of just gliding along the ground.
5. Audio and Game Mechanics: We implemented footsteps, background music, battle music, attack sounds, healing sounds, and a roaring sound for the dragon.
6. User Interface: We added a health bar for the corgi and its enemies. During encounters, a UI will pop up, showing you what controls allow you to perform certain actions. 

Controls: WASD to move. Once in combat, 1 to scratch, 2 to bite, 3 to heal, and 4 to run away.
